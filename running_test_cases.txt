Plese create a script to run the test cases,
Ensure it runs on linux.

Please perform the following steps to run the tests on your system.

*** Please delete the empty __init.py__ in the root directory as it causes error during run-time

Give createDB access to your user( in our case team1user). This can be performed via pgadmin or psql

Run python manage.py runserver And then in a differ shell run the tests via python manage.py test. This will automate the test and show it running.
The current code is configured to work with chrome and you may modify the code to work with any other browsers.
